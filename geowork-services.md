## Electrical well logging

Electrical well logging measures the properties of the undisturbed rocks and the fluids which they contain by measuring for self-potential, resistivity, and conductivity in a deep water well.

## Georesistivity survey

Georesistivity survey is performed to determine the subsurface characteristics of an area through geological resistivity methods. It is primarily used for potable groundwater prospecting applications.

## Deep Well Camera Inspection

Deep well camera inspection provides high-definition footage of a deep well and is used to determine its overall condition such as its casing, screen, and seals. This can also give insight about the water quality of the deep well especially after rehabilitation.

### Single view for narrow diameter deep wells

A single, down-facing deep well camera is suitable for inspecting narrow deep wells.

### Dual view for wide diameter deep wells

A dual-view, deep well camera is suitable for inspecting wide deep wells. This camera can provide down-the-hole view of the deep well and alternately, a side-facing view for a much closer inspection of the deep wellâ€™s casing, slots, and screens.
